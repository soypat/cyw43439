### Peripheral side APIs
Examples:
* [APA102](https://www.pololu.com/product/2554) addressable LED strip. 
    - Here is the [Go driver](https://github.com/tinygo-org/drivers/blob/release/apa102/apa102.go): well programmed and simple. Follows good practices like storing buffers in-struct as arrays (`buf` field) to avoid heap allocations and encouraging better CPU memory access patterns.
    - I could not find a high quality C or C++ driver, there seems to be a different driver for each microcontroller. [Here's an ESP8266](https://github.com/leonyuhanov/esp8266apa102driver/blob/master/apa102LEDStrip.cpp) driver for the APA102 which seemed reasonably well programmed.
* [Wifinina SPI driver](https://github.com/tinygo-org/drivers/tree/release/wifinina) for ESP32 wifi with TCP/IP.


### Microcontroller side APIs
The CYW43439 driver will have minimal microcontroller side API code, though it does not hurt to read up a little bit on it.

It may be of interest to the reader to know a bit of how one ports microcontroller specific code from C to Go. This code is characterized by the heavy use of [volatile memory registers](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/blob/c7a23183e822b9eebb639902414a0e08a09fbba0/src/machine/machine_rp2040_pwm.go#L40-L44) and [data structures that map peripheral functionality directly](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/blob/c7a23183e822b9eebb639902414a0e08a09fbba0/src/machine/machine_rp2040_pwm.go#L54) to these segments of volatile memory.

For the case of the RP2040 (the raspberry pi's pico microcontroller) one can find most of microcontroller specific code in the [TinyGo `machine` package](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/tree/release/src/machine)- Look for filenames starting with `machine_rp2040`. In the author's opinion one of the cleanest peripheral API's is the RP2040's I2C driver, which you may find in [`machine_rp2040_i2c.go`](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/blob/release/src/machine/machine_rp2040_i2c.go) in said package.

The C counterparts are in the [pico-sdk's `rp2_common` directory](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/tree/master/src/rp2_common). The I2C counterpart includes the [header file](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/blob/master/src/rp2_common/hardware_i2c/include/hardware/i2c.h) with function signatures and type definitions... and more interestingly, the actual code under [`hardware_i2c/i2c.c`](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/blob/master/src/rp2_common/hardware_i2c/i2c.c). Do note the port is *almost* direct. Some functions have been grouped differently and have slightly different signatures in the `Go` version.

The PWM API is much more closely matched between the [C](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/blob/master/src/rp2_common/hardware_pwm/include/hardware/pwm.h) and [Go](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/blob/release/src/machine/machine_rp2040_pwm.go) version, albeit much simpler.
